# Dynamic Programming Problems and Algorithms
### What you may learn here?
This repository is full of classical graph theory algorithms and problems solution specially focused on competitive programming. Most of the solutions can be used as a template for further variance solution of specific category. Listed algorithms are very naive and common. For detailed explation follow [Graph Algorithms](http://dimik.pub/book/104/graph-algorithm-by-shafaet-ashraf) book by Shafayet Ashraf.

*Language: C++*
